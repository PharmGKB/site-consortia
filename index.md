# Consortia Working Groups

The [PGRN](https://www.pgrn.org) works with [PharmGKB](http://www.pharmgkb.org), which convenes consortia in areas where researchers agree to share data and knowlege to answer common questions in pharmacogenomics.  Contact [feedback@pharmgkb.org](mailto:feedback@pharmgkb.org) to learn more.

If you were a contributor to a completed project and are looking for data from the project, please contact [feedback@pharmgkb.org](mailto:feedback@pharmgkb.org) and we will work with you to retrieve what you need.


### CPIC: Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium ([CPIC](https://www.cpic.org)) consists of members who will share their expertise to create, curate, review, and update written summaries and recommendations for implementing specific pharmacogenomic tests and practices.

For the latest on CPIC, visit the [CPIC website](https://www.cpic.org). 


### ICPC: International Clopidogrel Pharmacogenomics Consortium

The overall goal of the ICPC is to amass very large sample sizes and expertise from across the globe to dissect the genetic underpinnings of variable response to clopidogrel.


### ISPC: International SSRI Pharmacogenomics Consortium

The overall goal of the ISPC is to amass a large sample and expertise from across the globe to dissect the genetic underpinnings of variable response to a major class of antidepressant drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
 

### ITPC: International Tamoxifen Pharmacogenomics Consortium

Pharmacogenomics research centers have collected and combined data relating CYP2D6 genotype and clinical outcomes in women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for early breast cancer to establish the relationships between CYP2D6 metabolism status and tamoxifen efficacy.


### IWPC: International Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Consortium

A number of pharmacogenomics research centers have collected data sets relating warfarin dosing to a variety of clinical and genetic parameters including genotypes of CYP2C9 and VKORC1. Groups are sharing their data, in order to develop a consensus model for dosing that is consistent with all data.
 

### IWPC-GWAS: Genome Wide Association Studies

A number of pharmacogenomics research centers (the "consortium") are interested in discovering new genetic variants that are important for warfarin dosing using genome wide association studies (GWAS).
